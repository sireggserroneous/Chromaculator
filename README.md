# Chromaculator

An instrument for looking at integers. Lives at **chronochromatic.org**.

Write a number in hex, so its bits arrive padded to a whole nibble. Lay them most
significant first into the smallest square that holds them, and fold that square
along its main anti-diagonal into three regions — **Inner**, **Fold**, **Outer** —
which sum back to the number exactly. Blue is +1, red is −1, green is 0. Negating a
number flips every colour.

Cell *i* weighs 2<sup>−(i+1)</sup>, so the value is *k* / 2<sup>4·nibbles</sup> —
always a dyadic rational strictly inside (−1, 1).

## The pages

| | |
|---|---|
| **Spectrometer** | one integer in full: its stalk, its square, its three regions, its value as a light wave, and its point on the unit sphere |
| **Atlas** | every integer as a ring of dyadics, ordered by value. Ring *r* is the 2<sup>r+1</sup> roots of unity; selecting one draws a radius and lights the path down to it |
| **Wub** | integers as phasors summed tip to tail, each riding an ellipsoid, tracing one closed curve. Torus knots, crossing counts, and a curve you can export |
| **Wub ×** | multiplication as a rectangle; an ordered sequence of operands |
| **Wub ÷** | division kept exact: quotient, a multiplier on the boundary, and the remainder drawn |
| **Wubba Dub** | the wub as a graphing calculator: a pinned gallery, then one paged card per integer |
| **Spec** | the convention, editable in the page |
| **Inspirations** | who found each piece of this first |

## Running it

```
python3 serve.py        # http://localhost:1338
```

Static files plus one `PUT` endpoint so `spec.md` can be edited from the Spec page.
Only that one file is writable. On a static host the site still works; the Spec page
becomes read-only.

## Checking a change

```
node tools/run.js wub.html      # does the page's JavaScript actually run?
node tools/product.test.js      # the product grid, against the arithmetic
node tools/wubx.test.js         # Wub x, including the parts run.js cannot reach
node tools/gizmo.test.js        # the corner gizmo points where it says
node tools/divide.test.js       # A = 2^e x Q x B + R, at every width
node tools/wubdiv.test.js       # Wub div, including the parts run.js cannot reach
node tools/load.test.js         # all three Wub pages under a full rack
node tools/wubbadub.test.js     # the paged cards, and the helix fitting its box
node tools/bulk.test.js         # 10,000 integers through both grids (~20s)
```

`run.js` runs a page's JavaScript against a stand-in DOM. A 200 from the server says
nothing about whether the page's scripts executed; this does. See `tools/`.

## What is original here

Very little of the mathematics. Signed digits are Booth and Avizienis, the stalks are
Conway's, the bit reversal is van der Corput and Cooley–Tukey, the ring geometry is a
rotary encoder disc, the phasor sum is Fourier epicycles. See **Inspirations** for the
full accounting, with links.

What I have not been able to place is the fold itself: laying a digit string along the
anti-diagonals of a square and cutting it into three regions that sum back to the
number. Held loosely.
